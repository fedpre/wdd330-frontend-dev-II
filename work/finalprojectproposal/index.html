      # Currency Exchange Calculator

## Overview
The project will develop a web app in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that will allow the user to calculate the currency exchange. It will pull live currency exchange data from an API endpoint to provide the latest pricing available.

## Audience
The audience is the general population that needs to find the currency exchange rate of a certain amount quickly and effectively. It is always hard and time-consuming to calculate manually the exchange so I want to help my audience to quickly navigate the complicated area of currency exchange.

## Specific Functionalities
There will be one input field where to put the amount, a dropdown menu to choose the beginning currency, another dropdown to choose the final currency and an output area to see the new value. 

There is also an historical data section where you can see all of your past entries. It will be saved in the localstorage. 

The UI will be very simple and intuitive allowing the user to quickly get the desired outcome. 

There will be a submit button that will send a form that will be processed with JavaScript to have the correct output.
