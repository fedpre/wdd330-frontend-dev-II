      > Error and bugs are a fact of life in programming - they will always be there.

      ## Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings
      
      Three types of errors:
      1. **System error** ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.
      2. **Programmer error** ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.
        1. Our responsibility to try to minimize these errors
      3. **User error** ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.
        1. Our responsibility to try to predict all the cases and help the user avoid mistakes
      
      > It might even be argued that user errors are in fact also programmer errors, because the program should be designed in a way that prevents the user from making the error.
      
      An **Exception** is an error that produces a return value that can be used by the programmer to deal with the error
      
      ```javascript
      unicorn()
      << ReferenceError: unicors is not defined
      ```
      
      An exception usually produces a **stack trace**. This is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred.
      
      ```javascript
      function three(){ unicorn(); }
      function two(){ three(); }
      function one(){ two(); }
      one();
      
      << index.html:13 Uncaught ReferenceError: unicorn is not defined
          at three (index.html:13)
          at two (index.html:17)
          at one (index.html:21)
          at index.html:24`
      ```
      
      A **Warning** can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash.
      
      ```javascript
      pi = 3.142;
      << JavaScript Warning: assignment to undeclared variable
      ```
      
      JavaScript will continue working with a warning but possibly incorrectly. 
      
      ## The Importance of Testing and Debugging
      Errors and warning are crucial to make sure that the program works correctly. Fail loudly in dev mode and fail gracefuly in production. Make sure that exceptions are caught and dealth with and code is tested throughly.
      
      ## Strict Mode
      ECMAScript 5 introduced a strict mode that produces more exceptions and warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated features.
      
      > It is much better to spot errors early on
      
      To enable strict mode, simply add this line of code on the first line of the JS file:
      ```javascript
      'use strict';
      ```
      
      You can use the strict mode on a per function basis but adding the code inside the function as its first line:
      ```javascript
      function strictly(){
      'use strict';
      // function code goes here
      ```
      
      In fact, the recommended way to invoke strict mode is to place all your code into a self-invoking function (covered in more detail in Chapter 12), like so:
      
      ```javascript
      (function() {
          'use strict';
      
          // All your code would go inside this function
      
      }());
      
      // syntax for a self-invoking function. 
      // This function will be invoked as soon as it is created
      
      (function() {
        // code here
      }())
      ```
      
      Learn more about [self-invoking functions](https://linuxhint.com/self-invoking-functions-in-javascript/)
      
      > ES6 introduced JavaScript modules (covered later in chapter 15). These are self-contained pieces of code that are in strict mode by default, so the `'use strict'` declaration is not required.
      
      ### Linting Tools
      Linting tools such as [JS Lint,](http://jslint.com/)[JS Hint,](http://jshint.com/) and [ES Lint](http://eslint.org/) can be used to test the quality of JavaScript code, beyond simply using strict mode. They are designed to highlight any sloppy programming practices or syntax errors, and will complain if certain style conventions are not followed, such as how code is indented.
      
      Linting tools are also useful for enforcing a programming **style guide**. This is particularly useful when you are working in a team, as it ensures everybody follows the same conventions.
      
      Passing a lint test is no guarantee that your code is correct, but it will mean it will be more consistent and less likely to have problems.
      
      You can read more about how to use ESLint in [this article on SitePoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/up-and-running-with-eslint-the-pluggable-javascript-linter/).
      
      ## Feature Detection
      There are always new APIs developed and JS is in constant development. Browsers try to keep up but we cannot rely on the fact that everyone will have the latest browsers.
      
      The recommended way to determine browser support for a feature is to use feature detection. This is done using an `if` statement to check whether an object or method exists before trying to actually call the method. For example, say we want to use the shiny new `holoDeck` API (as far as I know, this doesn't actually exist ... yet), we would wrap any method calls inside the following `if` block:
      
      ```javascript
      if (window.holoDeck) {
          virtualReality.activate();
      }
      
      // The browser that doesn't have holoDeck won't run what's inside the if statement, thus avoiding an exception to be thrown
      ```
      
      Feature detection guarantees that the method is only called if it actually exists and fails gracefully, without any exceptions being thrown, if the method doesn't exist.
      
      [Modernizr](https://modernizr.com/docs) is a library that offers an easy way to implement feature detection and [Can I Use?](http://caniuse.com/) is another useful resource for checking which features are currently supported in different browsers.
      
      ## Debugging in the Browser
      
      > Debugging is the process of finding out where bugs occur in the code and then dealing with them.
      
      It can be useful to create what are known as breakpoints, which halt the progress of the code and allow us to view the value of different variables at that point in the program.
      
      ### The Trusty Alert
      
      The most basic form of debugging is to use the `alert()` method to show a dialog at certain points in the code. Because `alert()` stops a program from running until OK is clicked, it allows us to effectively put breakpoints in the code that let us check the value of variables at that point to see if they’re what we expect them to be.
      
      ```javascript
      function amIOldEnough(age){
          if (age < 12) {
              alert(age);
              return 'No, sorry.';
          } else if (age < 18) {
              return 'Only if you are accompanied by an adult.';
          }
          else {
              return 'Yep, come on in!';
          }
      }
      ```
      
      Using alerts for debugging was the only option in the past, but JavaScript development has progressed since then and their use is discouraged for debugging purposes today.
      
      ### Using the Console
      
      Most modern JavaScript environments have a `console` object that provides a number of methods for logging information and debugging. It's not officially part of the ECMAScript specification, but is well supported in all the major browsers and Node.js.
      
      Use the `console.log()` method to log in the console what is happening.
      The `console.trace()` will log an interactive stack trace in the console.
      
      [This SitePoint post](http://www.sitepoint.com/three-little-known-development-console-api-methods/) also lists a few other useful but little-known methods of the `console` object.
      
      ### Debugging Tools
      
      Most modern browsers also have a debugging tool that allows you to set **breakpoints** in your code that will pause it at certain points.
      
      Here are the links to the debugger documentation for each of the major browsers:
      
      -   [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Debugger)
      -   [Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/f12-devtools-guide/debugger)
      -   [Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/javascript-debugging)
      -   [Safari](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/Safari_Developer_Guide/Debugger/Debugger.html)
      
      One of the most useful commands is the `debugger` keyword. This will create a breakpoint in your code that will pause the execution of the code and allow you to see where the program is currently up to.
      
      ```javascript
      function amIOldEnough(age){
          debugger;
              if (age < 12) {
              debugger;
              return 'No, sorry.';
              } else if (age < 18) {
              debugger;
              return 'Only if you are accompanied by an adult.';
              } else {
              debugger;
              return 'Yep, come on in!';
          }
      }
      
      amIOldEnough(16);
      ```
      
      > Remember to remove any references to the `debugger` command before shipping any code, otherwise the program will appear to freeze when people try to use it!
      
      ## Error Objects
      
      An `error` object can be created by the host environment when an exception occurs, or it can be created in the code using a constructor function, like so:
      
      ```javascript
      const error = new Error();
      ```
      
      This constructor function takes a parameter that’s used as the error message:
      
      ```javascript
      const error = new Error('Oops, something went wrong');
      ```
      
      There are seven more error objects used for specific errors:
      
      -   `EvalError` is not used in the current ECMAScript specification and only retained for backwards compatibility. It was used to identify errors when using the global `eval()` function.
      -   `RangeError` is thrown when a number is outside an allowable range of values.
      -   `ReferenceError` is thrown when a reference is made to an item that doesn’t exist. For example, calling a function that hasn't been defined.
      -   `SyntaxError` is thrown when there’s an error in the code’s syntax.
      -   `TypeError` is thrown when there’s an error in the type of value used; for example, a string is used when a number is expected.
      -   `URIError` is thrown when there’s a problem encoding or decoding the URI.
      -   `InternalError` is a non-standard error that is thrown when an error occurs in the JavaScript engine. A common cause of this too much recursion.
          
      
      These error objects can also be used as constructors to create custom error objects:
      
      ```javascript
      const error = new TypeError('You need to use numbers in this function');
      ```
      
      All `error` objects have a number of properties, but they’re often used inconsistently across browsers. The only properties that are generally safe to use are:
      
      -   The `name` property returns the name of the error constructor function used as a string, such as 'Error' or 'ReferenceError'.
      -   The `message` property returns a description of the error and should be provided as an argument to the `Error` constructor function.
      -   The `stack` property will return a stack trace for that error. This is a non-standard property and it’s recommended that it is not safe to use in production sites.
      
      ### Throwing Exceptions
      It is possible to throw your own exceptions with the `throw` statement. 
      > This will allow for any problems in your code to be highlighted and dealt with, rather than lurk quietly in the background.
      
      It is best practice to `throw` an `error` object and then it can be caught in a `catch` block.
      ```javascript
      throw new Error('something has gone badly wrong!');
      ```
      
      As an example, let’s write a function called `squareRoot()` to find the square root of a number. This can be done using the `Math.sqrt()` method, but it returns `NaN` for negative arguments.
      
      ```javascript
      function squareRoot(number) {
          'use strict';
          if (number < 0) {
              throw new RangeError('You can't find the square root of negative numbers')
          }
          return Math.sqrt(number);
      };
      ```
      
      ## Exception handling
      
      When an exception occurs, the program terminates with an error message. This is ideal in development as it allows us to identify and fix errors. In production, however, it will appear as if the program has crashed, which does not reflect well on a good programmer.
      
      It is possible to handle exceptions gracefully by catching the error. Any errors can be hidden from users, but still identified. We can then deal with the error appropriately ― perhaps even ignore it ― and keep the program running.
      
      ### `try`, `catch`, and `finally`
      
      We can wrap code inside a `try` block if we believe it may throw an exception. We can then use a `catch` block to deal with the error. Example: 
      
      ```javascript
      function imaginarySquareRoot(number) {
          'use strict';
          try {
              return String(squareRoot(number));
          } catch(error) {
              return squareRoot(-number)+'i';
          }
      }
      ```
      
      A `finally` block can be added after a `catch` block. This will always be executed after the `try` or `catch` block, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It is useful if you want some code to run in both cases. We can use this to modify the `imaginarySquareRoot()` function so that it adds "+ or -" to the answer before returning it:
      
      ```javascript
      function imaginarySquareRoot(number) {
          'use strict';
          let answer;
          try {
              answer = String(squareRoot(number));
          } catch(error) {
              answer = squareRoot(-number)+"i";
          } finally {
              return `+ or - ${answer}`;
          }
      }
      ```
      
      You can read more about how to handle errors effectively in [this article on SitePoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/proper-error-handling-javascript/).
      
      ## Tests
      
      Testing is an important part of programming that can often be overlooked. Writing good tests means your code will be less brittle as it develops, and any errors will be identified early on.
      
      For example, we could test that the `squareRoot()` function that we wrote earlier returns the correct answer with the following function:
      
      ```javascript
      function itSquareRoots4() {    return squareRoot(4) === 2;}
      ```
      
      ### Test-driver Development
      
      **Test-driven development** (TDD) is the process of writing tests before any actual code. 
      1. Write tests before code
      2. Write code that makes the test pass
      3. Refactor code to make it faster, more readable, and remove repetitions
      4. Test refactored code
      5. write more tests for new features
      
      Test-driven development is considered to be best practice, but in reality you'll find most developers tend to be more pragmatic when it comes to writing tests. 
      
      The TDD mindset can be hard to always use, and at the end of the day, any tests are better than no tests at all. In fact, [this post by David Heinemeier Hansson](http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/tdd-is-dead-long-live-testing.html) shows that even the very best coders don't always use TDD, and make no apologies for not doing so. 
      
      We cover an example in this chapter, but won't be using it for the most of the examples in the rest of the book as it would make it far too long!
      
      ### Testing Frameworks
      
      Testing frameworks provide a structure to write meaningful tests and then run them.
      
      #### Jest
      
      [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) is a TDD framework, created by Facebook, that has gained a lot of popularity recently. It makes it easy to create and run tests by providing helper methods for common test assertions.
      
      To use Jest, first we need to install it using `npm`. Enter the following command in a terminal:
      
      ```javascript
      npm install -g jest
      ```
      
      This should install Jest globally. To check everything worked okay, try running the following command to check the version number that has been installed:
      
      ```javascript
      jest -v
      << v19.0.2
      ```
      
      The version number might be different on your install, but if it returns a value, it means Jest is installed correctly.
      
      Create a file called `squareRoot.test.js` and add the following code:
      
      ```javascript
      function squareRoot(number) {
          'use strict';
          if (number < 0) {
              throw new RangeError("You can't find the square root of negative numbers")
          }
          return Math.sqrt(number);
      };
      
      test('square root of 4 is 2', () => {
      expect(squareRoot(4)).toBe(2);
      });
      ```
      
      To run this test, simply navigate to the folder that contains the file `squareRoot.test.js` and enter the following command:
      
      ```shell
      jest -c {}
      ```
      
      This will run all files that end in 'test.js' within that folder. The `-c {}` flag at the end is shorthand for ‘configuration’. We don't need any extra configuration, so we simply pass it an empty object.
      
      ### Example: Crunching Some Numbers
      
      Create a small library called 'Number Cruncher' that will contain some functions that operate on numbers. The first function we’ll try to implement will be called `factorsOf()`. This will take a number as a parameter and return all the factors (The factors, or divisors, of a number are any integers that divide exactly into the number without leaving a remainder.
      
      Let's start out test first:
      ```javascript
      test('factors of 12', () => {
        expect(factorsOf(12)).toEqual([1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]);
      })
      ```
      
      > We have used the `toEqual()` match in this test. This is because we are testing an array.
      
      Create the function at the top of `numberCruncher.test.js`
      
      ```javascript
      'use strict';
      
      function factorsOf(n) {
      const factors = [];
          for (let i=1; i <= n ; i++) {
              if (n/i === Math.floor(n/i)){
              factors.push(i);
              }
      }
          return factors;
      }
      ```
      
      When the code passes the tests, still one step: **Refactoring**
      
      Let's refactor it this way:
      ```javascript
      function factorsOf(n) {
          const factors = [];
          for (let i=1 , max = Math.sqrt(n); i <= max ; i++) {
              if (n%i === 0){
              factors.push(i,n/i);
              }
          }
          return factors.sort((a,b) => a - b);
      }
      ```
      
      Make sure to re run the tests to see if they passes
      
      Use this process each time you implement a new feature.
